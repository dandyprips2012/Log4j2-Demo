# Log4j2-Demo

This application provides a way to provide generic logging to your application. You don't have to manually append log to every other request.
It uses Apache log4j2 version 2.10. A plugin converter is created alongwith two converter keys. 
You can add as many you want and update format method accordingly. 
A custom request string is parsed. It may vary based on requirements. Atleast you can get an idea.
